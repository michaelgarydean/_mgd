TAXONOMIES
---------------

Custom taxonomies are used to organize content and theme content. Currently using:

- Services
- Releases
- Projects

@TODO - These taxonomies need to be added into the functions.php file so they are set-up by default when theme is installed.

For distribution:
- We display custom tags depending on the category. User should be able to turn this on and off and select which tags to display for each post type, or category.
- Should also be able to display the post excerpt instead of the tags.
